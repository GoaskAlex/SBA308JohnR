Just needed more time. I was focused on trying to make the code for grades reusable. Sorting out the ending logic. Broke down the exam with, first how can the user access the class and is verifyed. Same with Class and assiments. Making sure all the datas logic is correct as the code reads down. Theres some old code committed out because it became complicated and manage to make code kinda cleaner.
